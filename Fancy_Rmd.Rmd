```

# This is a great title!

## You can totally see what a great coder I am 

### Here are some values 

```{r}
# Woohoo look at this code! 

a <- 3
b <- 47

c <- a * b 
```

# Another title 


### Look at the cool things I can do with the values 

```{r}
c <- a * b 

d <- (c * 38) + a - (b - 1)
```

### OK I am repeating  

```{r}
# Woohoo look at this code! 

a <- 3
b <- 47

c <- a * b 
```

# And look another title 

### its a trick 

```{r}
c <- a * b 

d <- (c * 38) + a - (b - 1)
```
